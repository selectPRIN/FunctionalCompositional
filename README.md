# FunctionalCompositional
This folder contains code for Stefanucci M. and Mazzuco M. 2020. "Analyzing Causeâ€“Specific Mortality Trends using Compo-
sitional Functional Data Analysis".

Data used in the paper are freely accessible at https://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/causeofdeath_query/start.php for each ICD (7, 8, 9, 10). 
There are four different "Read_ICDj.R" files (j=7,...,10), inside the folder ICD, one for each ICD data file. 
Run each Read_ICD.R file to get data files "ICDj_comp.csv" to be analysed with file PCA-men.R and PCA-women.R.

For questions about the code or packages, please contact Marco Stefanucci at marco.stefanucci@unipd.it or Stefano Mazzuco at stefano.mazzuco@unipd.it
